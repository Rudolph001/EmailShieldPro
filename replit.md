# SecureShield Email DLP - AI-Powered Enterprise Security Platform

## Overview

SecureShield is an advanced email security platform inspired by Tessian, featuring AI-powered policy management, real-time threat detection, and comprehensive data loss prevention capabilities. The system provides enterprise-grade email security through intelligent analysis, policy enforcement, and real-time monitoring of email communications.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** application with TypeScript for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom Tessian-inspired design system
- **shadcn/ui** component library for consistent, professional UI
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- **WebSocket integration** for real-time updates and live monitoring
- **Responsive design** optimized for desktop security dashboards

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** with TypeScript providing RESTful API endpoints
- **WebSocket server** for real-time communication and live updates
- **Modular service architecture** with separated concerns:
  - Authentication and session management
  - Email processing and analysis
  - Policy engine for rule evaluation
  - Machine learning service integration
  - Microsoft Graph API integration

### Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL** database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema-driven** approach with proper relationships and constraints
- **Migration support** through Drizzle Kit for database versioning

## Key Components

### Email Security Engine
- **Real-time email monitoring** with live analysis pipeline
- **AI-powered classification** using Python machine learning services
- **Policy enforcement** with configurable rules and actions
- **Threat detection** for phishing, malware, and suspicious content
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** with sensitive information protection

### Microsoft Graph Integration
- **OAuth 2.0** authentication flow for secure access
- **Multi-tenant support** for enterprise email systems
- **Token management** with refresh capabilities
- **Email fetching** with metadata extraction and content analysis

### Machine Learning Service
- **Python-based classifier** using scikit-learn and TensorFlow
- **Naive Bayes model** for email categorization
- **Natural Language Processing** for content analysis
- **Feature extraction** for threat pattern recognition
- **Continuous learning** capabilities for improving accuracy

### Policy Management System
- **Intelligent policy recommendations** based on organizational patterns
- **Risk-based policy creation** with automated suggestions
- **Policy testing and simulation** environment
- **Compliance intelligence** with industry best practices
- **Drag-and-drop policy builder** interface

### Real-time Dashboard
- **Live metrics** with WebSocket-powered updates
- **Security analytics** with comprehensive reporting
- **Threat visualization** and interactive charts
- **User activity monitoring** and audit trails
- **Predictive risk analysis** and forecasting

## Data Flow

1. **Email Ingestion**: Microsoft Graph API fetches emails from connected accounts
2. **Content Extraction**: Email metadata, subject, and body content are extracted
3. **ML Analysis**: Python service analyzes content for threats and classification
4. **Policy Evaluation**: Policy engine applies organizational rules and policies
5. **Threat Detection**: System identifies and categorizes security threats
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket broadcasts events to connected dashboards
7. **Action Enforcement**: Automated responses based on policy configurations
8. **Audit Logging**: All activities are logged for compliance and analysis

## External Dependencies

### Microsoft Services
- **Microsoft Graph API** for email access and Office 365 integration
- **Azure Active Directory** for authentication and tenant management
- **OAuth 2.0** for secure token-based authentication

### Machine Learning Stack
- **Python 3.x** runtime environment
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms
- **TensorFlow** for advanced pattern recognition
- **NumPy/Pandas** for data processing and analysis

### Database and Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL** for primary data storage
- **Neon Database** for serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **WebSocket** for real-time communication

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Replit-optimized** development setup with hot reloading
- **Vite** for fast frontend development and building
- **TypeScript** compilation and type checking
- **Environment variables** for secure credential management

### Production Considerations
- **Database migrations** managed through Drizzle Kit
- **Static asset optimization** with Vite build process
- **API rate limiting** and security headers
- **Session management** with PostgreSQL session store
- **Error handling** and monitoring capabilities

The architecture prioritizes security, scalability, and real-time performance while maintaining a clean separation of concerns and following enterprise security best practices.
