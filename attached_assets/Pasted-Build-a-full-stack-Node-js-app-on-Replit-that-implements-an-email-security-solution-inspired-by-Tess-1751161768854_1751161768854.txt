Build a full-stack Node.js app on Replit that implements an email security solution inspired by Tessian.

The app should do the following:

Authenticate and connect to multiple Microsoft Outlook inboxes across a company using Microsoft Graph API.

Use OAuth2 with environment variables for credentials.

Fetch the last 5 emails for each user.

Send email data (subject + body) to a Python machine learning service running locally (called via python-shell).

The ML model should classify emails as "suspicious" or "safe" based on the content.

Use a simple but effective text classifier like a Naive Bayes model with sklearn.

For each suspicious email detected:

Log detailed information to the Replit console in real-time.

Trigger an alert (this can be console output initially but should be extensible to email, Slack, or webhook).

Structure the project to be modular and secure:

Store all sensitive credentials (client ID, tenant ID, client secret) as environment variables using Replitâ€™s Secrets.

Use clear, maintainable code files (e.g., auth.js for auth, ml_service.py for ML, index.js for main logic).

Bonus Features:

Add support to loop through a dynamic list of users or emails pulled from a config or database.

Include detailed logging with timestamps and email metadata.

Provide comments and instructions for extending the ML model or integrating with alerting systems like Slack or PagerDuty.

Deliverable:

A ready-to-run Replit project with clear README instructions.

Code that runs immediately on Run, fetching emails, classifying them, and showing results live in the console.

Please build the project with clean, production-level code and provide comments for each step.
